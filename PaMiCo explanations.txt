
Passap-microConsole PaMiCo was programmed in CUBE IDE 
with the GNU ARM v132 compiler.

Hardware: "Blue pill" with STM32F103C8 chip.
The compiled file Passap-microConsole.bin is located in the debug folder.

Passap-micro Console connects to the Windows OS computer via USB. 
The driver must be installed: "STM32 Virtual COM Port Driver".

You also need to have it on your computer
- a terminal program installed on the computer to use the CLI
(command line interface) to control the "selector support" of the knitting machine
and load simple knitting patterns ;
- Python 3 to use the PyPaMiCo GUI to convert and load knitting patterns 
from JPG image files.

The current first initial version of PaMiCo is created for testing purposes only and 
does not involve the use of a real knitting machine at this stage of work. 
The output signal is output to the Bluepill's built-in LED and to terminal screen.
