
Passap-microConsole.bin was initially created by CUBE MX version 5.0.0, 
programmed in CUBE IDE version 15 and compiled by the GNU ARM v132 compiler.
Hardware: "Bluepill" with STM32F103CB chip.
The CUBE MX source file is quite simple and is included with the project, 
so there should be no problem playing this project on any other suitable platforms.

To check PaMiCo, it is enough to have any computer with USB,
64K "Bluepill" (and/or STLink programmer or RS232 serial port on PC plus USB-TTL converter,
in case Bluepill does not have a bootloader). It is also necessary to have
a terminal program installed on the computer to use the CLI 
(command line interface) and installed Python 3 to use the PyPaMiCo GUI.

The current first initial version of PaMiCo is created for testing purposes only and 
does not involve the use of a real knitting machine at this stage of work.
