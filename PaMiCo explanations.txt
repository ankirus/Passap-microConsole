
Passap-microConsole.bin was originally created by CUBE MX version 5.0.0, programmed in CUBE IDE version 15 and compiled by the GNU ARM v132 compiler.
Hardware: Bluepill with STM32F103CB chip.
The CUBE MX source file is quite simple and is included with the project, so there should be no problem playing this project on any other suitable platforms.
